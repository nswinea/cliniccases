### Getting Started (Clinic Administrators) ###

A default account should have been created with the username and password admin/admin. (Please delete this account after you have finished setting up ClinicCases. Important). Navigate to index.php in your browser and login using this account. Get started by clicking the "Users" tab and adding users. The best thing to do is to add professors and adminstrators first.

When professors first log in to their account, it is important that they configure their class so that they and their students will see the correct tabs.  To do this, click on Preferences and then Configure Class.  Professors who work on cases with their students should select "I work on cases" and "My Students work on cases."  This will cause the case tab to appear the next time the professor logs in and will ensure that each student assigned to the professor will have a case tab.  If the professor wants to use journals, he should also check "My students write journals."

Students can get accounts by navigating to ./newaccount/index.php and submitting their information there. The adminstrator will then receive notification of this student signup and can authorize students using the New Users dialog on the At A Glance screen. More information on this here: 	 AddingAndManagingUsers.

You should then define your case types (criminal, family law, etc), dispositions (closed, judgment granted, referred, etc) and courts by navigating to the Prefs tab and clicking Edit Menus. More information on this here

After this, add cases via the cases tab. You must be logged in as an adminstrator to do this.
