### How to Change Your Password ###

To change your password, navigate to the Prefs tab and click "Change Your Password."  You will be prompted to enter your old password and then the new one. Once you submit the form, your password will be changed.

### Lost Username or Password ###

If you have forgotten your username or password, go to the main page and click on "Forgot username or password?".  You will be prompted for your email address.  Once submitted, a temporary password will be emailed to you.  You should log in with that password and then [change your password to something you will remember](PasswordAndUsernames.md).

### Changing Usernames ###

Usernames are assigned by the ClinicCases system and cannot be changed by the user.  The only way to change usernames is to have your system adminstrator change them in the mysql table.
