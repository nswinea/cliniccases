## Adding New Users ##

New Users are added by users who are administrators.  To add a new user, you should click on the "Users" tab and then click the [new user icon](https://cliniccases.com/images/new_user.png).  You should then enter in the user's information and upload a photo (optional).  After pressing submit, an email will be sent to the user with a temporary password.  The user can then log in and [[password | change his/her password ](change.md)].

## Saving Time Entering New Users (Student Users Only) ##

In order to save staff time on data entry, it is recommended that the new students apply for a ClinicCases account when they enter your clinic.  To do this, tell students to click on the "Students: New Account" link on the main page.  It is assumed that the student knows who his/her professor is for the academic year.  Once this form is submitted, the student will receive a confirmation email telling him that his account is awaiting for approval.  Administrators are informed of the application via email and by a notification on the At a Glance page .  The administrator must then approve the account by clicking on the appropriate icon on the At a Glance page.  Without this, the student will not have access to ClinicCases. This step is necessary for security purposes to prevent unauthorized access.

## Editing User Information ##

In order to edit user information, you must be an administrator.  Go the the "Users" tab and click on the user whose information you wish to edit.  A detail screen will come up with the users details.  To change, click edit and enter the new user information.  As of ClinicCases 6, professors and students cannot change their own information.  This must be done by an administrator.

## Deactivating Users ##

To control whether a user has access to ClinicCases, go to the "Users" tab.  Next to each name, you will see their group, date added, and current status (active or inactive).  To change the current status, click the "Change Status" link.  An inactive user cannot log into ClinicCases.
